The objective of this assignment is to expose the SW engineer to the fundamental of developing an 
application that covers the following:
1. Identity and access control of an application
2. State transition with pre & post actions to be triggered for a workflow which is usually 
implemented in projects. Eg. Case management, eSOP, etc. The pre & post actions contain the 
process/business rules, constraints for the respective business workflows
3. REST API for system integration purposes
4. Containerize the Nodejs application and API

In this assignment we shall build a Task Management System that emulate the Kanban approach. A kanban 
board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and 
maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both Agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. 
Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams 
commit to the right amount of work, and get it done! Please refer to the following URL for more info.
